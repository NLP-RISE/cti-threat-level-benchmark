The vulnerability, CVE-2024-47575 / FG-IR-24-423, allows a threat actor to use an unauthorized, threat actor-controlled FortiManager device to execute arbitrary code or commands against vulnerable FortiManager devices. \r\n\r\nMandiant observed a new threat cluster we now track as UNC5820 exploiting the FortiManager vulnerability as early as June 27, 2024. UNC5820 staged and exfiltrated the configuration data of the FortiGate devices managed by the exploited FortiManager. This data contains detailed configuration information of the managed appliances as well as the users and their FortiOS256-hashed passwords. This data could be used by UNC5820 to further compromise the FortiManager, move laterally to the managed Fortinet devices, and ultimately target the enterprise environment.\r\n\r\nAt this time, the data sources analyzed by Mandiant did not record the specific requests that the threat actor used to leverage the FortiManager vulnerability. Additionally, at this stage of our investigations there is no evidence that UNC5820 leveraged the obtained configuration data to move laterally and further compromise the environment. As a result, at the time of publishing, we lack sufficient data to assess actor motivation or location. As additional information becomes available through our investigations, Mandiant will update this blogâ€™s attribution assessment.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that may have their FortiManager exposed to the internet should conduct a forensic investigation immediately.",

If successful, the action embedded in the malicious link will be processed and accepted by the targeted application with the users' privilege level. This type of attack leverages the persistence and implicit trust placed in user session cookies by many web applications today. In such an architecture, once the user authenticates to an application and a session cookie is created on the user's system, all following transactions for that session are authenticated using that cookie including potential actions initiated by an attacker and simply \"riding\" the existing session cookie.",

The token can be regenerated at every request so that if a request with an invalid token is encountered, it can be reliably discarded. The token is considered invalid if it arrived with a request other than the action it was supposed to be associated with. Although less reliable, the use of the optional HTTP Referrer header can also be used to determine whether an incoming request was actually one that the user is authorized for, in the current context. Additionally, the user can also be prompted to confirm an action every time an action concerning potentially sensitive data is invoked. This way, even if the attacker manages to get the user to click on a malicious link and request the desired action, the user has a chance to recover by denying confirmation. This solution is also implicitly tied to using a second factor of authentication before performing such actions.
