### External analysis
* comment: The Bit Paymer ransomware — sometimes also spelled as Bitpaymer — first came to Bleeping Computer's attention on July 11, when security researcher Michael Gillespie tweeted a link to a sample uploaded on VirusTotal, a web-based file scanning service.

Fellow researcher MalwareHunter told Bleeping Computer today in a private conversation that following the NHS Lanarkshire attacks, more samples were found on VirusTotal going back to June 21, 2017, hinting that more campaigns might have taken place before the NHS Lanarkshire incident.

Unlike most ransomware we see today, Bit Paymer is well coded and appears to be the work of experienced programmers.
