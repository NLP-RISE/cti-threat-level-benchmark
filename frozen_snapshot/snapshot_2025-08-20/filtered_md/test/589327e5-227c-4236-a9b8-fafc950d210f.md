### External analysis
* text: Egyptian NGOs are currently being targeted by Nile Phish, a large-scale phishing campaign.
Almost all of the targets we identified are also implicated in Case 173, a sprawling legal case brought by the Egyptian government against NGOs, at ich has been referred to as an â€œunprecedented crackdownâ€ on Egyptâ€™s civil society.
Nile Phish operators demonstrate an intimate knowledge of Egyptian NGOs, and are able to roll out phishing attacks within hours of government actions, such as arrests.
