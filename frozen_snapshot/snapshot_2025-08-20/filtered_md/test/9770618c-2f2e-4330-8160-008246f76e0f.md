### Other
* comment: PowerShell script runs via the Task Scheduler and downloads the lgntoerr.gif file from a remote server.
    The script decrypts lgntoerr.gif, resulting in a .NET DLL, which is then loaded.
    The .NET DLL extracts and decrypts three files from its resources: two DLLs and an encrypted payload. The extracted files are placed in the ProgramData directory.
    The .NET DLL creates a task to autorun the legitimate ilasm.exe component at system startup via Task Scheduler.
    Task Scheduler starts ilasm.exe from the ProgramData directory.
    ilasm.exe launches fusion.dll, a malicious DLL hijacker, from the same directory.
    fusion.dll loads the second decrypted DLL.
    That DLL creates a suspended dllhost.exe process.
    It then decrypts the payload from the encrypted binary file.
    The decrypted payload is loaded into the dllhost.exe process as a DLL.
    The PID of the dllhost.exe process is saved to a file in the ProgramData directory.
    The dllhost.exe process passes control to the decrypted payload.
    The payload DLL extracts and launches the miner DLL in memory.
