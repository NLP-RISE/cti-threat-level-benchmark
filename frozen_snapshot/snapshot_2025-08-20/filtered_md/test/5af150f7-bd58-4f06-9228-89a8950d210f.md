* text: In our quest to track criminals and expose their misconduct, we regularly monitor the threat actor that goes by the name APT28, Fancy Bear, STRONTIUM, Pawn Storm, Sednit. Granted some of these names are toolsets used by the criminals a name for a group. If tomorrow, theyâ€™d come to use different toolsets these names would have no real meaning. Iâ€™d prefer to use the term APT28 because it is easier than making up ours, and there are enough already. Sofacy/Sednit are the toolsets used by APT28 among others such as XAgent.
