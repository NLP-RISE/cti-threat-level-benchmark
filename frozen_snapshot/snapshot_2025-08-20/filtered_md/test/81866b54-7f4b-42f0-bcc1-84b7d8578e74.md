* [Other] text: On 10th January 2024, Ivanti disclosed two zero-day critical vulnerabilities affecting Connect Secure VPN product: CVE-2024-21887 and CVE-2023-46805 allowing unauthenticated remote code execution. Volexity and Mandiant published articles reporting how these vulnerabilities were actively exploited by a threat actor. On 18th January, Volexity published new observations including hashes of Rust payloads downloaded on compromised Ivanti Connect Secure instances. This article presents a malware analysis of these unidentified Rust payloads that I labelled as KrustyLoader.
