* comment: A ransomware called Cerber has been floating around for about a week, but we were not able to retrieve a sample until today. Thanks to @BiebsMalwareGuy and @MeegulWorth, samples were found and further analysis of the ransomware could be done.  When infected, a victim's data files will be encrypted using AES encryption and will be told they need to pay a ransom of 1.24 bitcoins or ~500 USD to get their files back. Unfortunately, at this point there is no known way to decrypt a victim's encrypted files for free.

At this time we do not currently know how the Cerber ransomware is being distributed, but according to SenseCy, it is being offered as a service on a closed underground Russian forum. This means that it is probably a new Ransomware as a Service, or RaaS, where affiliates can join in order to distribute the ransomware, while the Cerber developers earn a commission from each ransom payment.
