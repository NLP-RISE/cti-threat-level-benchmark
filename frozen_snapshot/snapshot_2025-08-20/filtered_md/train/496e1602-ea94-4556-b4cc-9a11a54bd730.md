### Other
* comment: SentinelLabs has been tracking the activity of an Iranian-aligned threat actor operating in the Middle-East and the US.
* comment: Due to the threat actor’s heavy reliance on tunneling tools, as well as the unique way it chooses to widely deploy those, we track this cluster of activity as TunnelVision.
* comment: Much like other Iranian threat actors operating in the region lately, TunnelVision’s activities were linked to deployment of ransomware, making the group a potentially destructive actor.
* comment: The exploitation of Log4j in VMware Horizon is characterized by a malicious process spawned from the Tomcat service of the VMware product (%PROGRAMFILES%\VMware\VMware View\Server\bin\ws_TomcatService.exe)
