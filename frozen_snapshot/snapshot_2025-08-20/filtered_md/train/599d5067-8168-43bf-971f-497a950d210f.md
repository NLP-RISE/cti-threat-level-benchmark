* comment: Yesterday, I found an interesting sample that I started to analyze… It reached my spam trap attached to an email in Portuguese with the subject: "Venho por meio desta solicitar orçamento dos produtos” ("I hereby request the products budget”). There was one attached ZIP archive: PanilhaOrcamento.zip (SHA1: 3c159f65ba88bb208df30822d2a88b6531e4d0a7) with a VT score of 0/58.
