* comment: Trojan:Win32/Kovter is a well-known click-fraud malware which is challenging to detect and remove because of its file-less persistence on infected PCs. In this blog, we will share some technical details about the latest changes we have seen in Kovterâ€™s persistence method and some updates on their latest malvertising campaigns.

New persistence method
Since June 2016, Kovter has changed their persistence method to make remediation harder for antivirus software.
