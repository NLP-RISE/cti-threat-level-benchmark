* text: Turla is a notorious espionage group, and has been active for at least ten years. It came to light in 2008, when Turla breached the US Department of Defense [1]. Since then, there have been numerous security incidents involving Turla targeting several governments and sensitive businesses such as the defense industry [2].

Our January 2018 white paper [3] was the first public analysis of a Turla campaign called Mosquito. We have also published indicators of compromise [4]. Since then, the campaign has remained very active and attackers have been busy changing their tactics to remain as stealthy as possible.

Starting in March 2018, we observed a significant change in the campaign: it now leverages the open source exploitation framework Metasploit before dropping the custom Mosquito backdoor. It is not the first time Turla has used generic tools. In the past, we have seen the group using open-source password dumpers such as Mimikatz. However, to our knowledge, this is the first time Turla has used Metasploit as a first stage backdoor, instead of relying on one of its own tools such as Skipper [5].
