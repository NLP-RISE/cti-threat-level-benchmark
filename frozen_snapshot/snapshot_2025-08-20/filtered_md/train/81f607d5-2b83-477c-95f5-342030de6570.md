* [Other] text: - Check Point Research uncovers a targeted campaign carried out by a Chinese threat actor targeting government entities in Europe, with a focus on foreign and domestic policy entities.
- The campaign leverages HTML Smuggling, a technique in which attackers hide malicious payloads inside HTML documents.
- Following a complex infection chain involving either archives or MSI files, the attacks deploy PlugX, an implant commonly associated with Chinese threat actors.
- The campaign, called SmugX, overlaps with previously reported activity by Chinese APT actors RedDelta and Mustang Panda. Although those two correlate to some extent with Camaro Dragon, there is insufficient evidence to link the SmugX campaign to the Camaro Dragon group.
