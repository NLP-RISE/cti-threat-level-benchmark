## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
### External analysis
* text: IBM analysts recently unveiled a first look at how threat actors may have placed Shamoon2 malware on systems in Saudi Arabia. Researchers showcased a potential malware lifecycle which started with spear phishing and eventually led to the deployment of the disk-wiping malware known as Shamoon. Their research showcased a set of downloaders and domains that could potentially lead to a more extensive malware distribution campaign.

While researching elements in the IBM report, ASERT discovered additional malicious domains, IP addresses, and artifacts. The basic functionality of the new documents and their PowerShell components matched what was previously disclosed. For more information on the overall capabilities of the malware, please review IBMâ€™s ongoing research.  It is our hope that by providing additional indicators, end-point investigators and network defenders will be able to discover and mitigate more Shamoon2 related compromises.
