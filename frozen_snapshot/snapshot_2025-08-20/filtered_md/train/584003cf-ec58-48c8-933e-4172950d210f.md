### Other
* comment: In January of 2016, we found various â€œSmsSecurityâ€ mobile apps that claimed to be from various banks. These apps supposedly generated one-time passwords (OTPs) that account holders could use to log into the bank; instead they turned out to be malicious apps that stole any password sent via SMS messages. These apps were also capable of receiving commands from a remote attacker, allowing them to take control of a userâ€™s device.

Since then, weâ€™ve found some new variants of this attack that add new malicious capabilities. These capabilities include: anti-analysis measures, automatic rooting, language detection, and remote access via TeamViewer. In addition, SmsSecurity now cleverly uses the accessibility features of Android to help carry out its routines in a stealthy manner, without interaction from the user. We detect these malicious apps as ANDROIDOS_FAKEBANK.OPSA.
