* text: Security researchers have uncovered new details about the infrastructure used by LoJax UEFI rootkit used in attacks from APT28. The analysis revealed two command and control (C2) servers were still active in early 2019.

LoJax rootkit is based on LoJack, a legitimate software that tracks and locates laptop, smartphone, or tablet devices. Its campaigns likely started towards the end of 2016, according to new research.

Because it has persistence on the system, LoJack was modified by the threat actors - APT28, also known as Fancy Bear, Sednit, Strontium, and Sofacy, to report to their server.
