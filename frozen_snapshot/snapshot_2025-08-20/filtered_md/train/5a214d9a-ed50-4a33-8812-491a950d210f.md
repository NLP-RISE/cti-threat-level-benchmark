### External analysis
* comment: A new tech support scam has been discovered that shows a fake BSOD, or Blue Screen of Death, on the infected computer and then displays an application that pretends to be a Troubleshooter for Windows. This Troubleshooter will then state that your computer cannot be fixed, blocks you from using Windows, and prompts you to purchase a program using PayPal to fix the "detected problems" and unlock the screen.
