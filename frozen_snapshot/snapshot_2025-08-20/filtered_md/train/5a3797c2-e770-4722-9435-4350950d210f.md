* comment: We have identified a new drive-by download campaign that distributes the Princess ransomware (AKA PrincessLocker), leveraging compromised websites and the RIG exploit kit. This is somewhat of a change for those tracking malvertising campaigns and their payloads.

We had analyzed the PrincessLocker ransomware last November and pointed out that despite similarities with Cerberâ€™s onion page, the actual code was much different. A new payment page seemed to have been seen in underground forums and is now being used with attacks in the wild.
