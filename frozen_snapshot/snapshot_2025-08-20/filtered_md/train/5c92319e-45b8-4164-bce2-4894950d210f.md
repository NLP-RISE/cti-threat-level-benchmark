* text: On March 17, 2019, 360 Threat Intelligence Center captured a target attack sample against the Middle East by exploiting WinRAR vulnerability (CVE-2018-20250[6]), and it seems that the attack is carried out by the Goldmouse APT group (APT-C-27). There is a decoy Word document inside the archive regarding terrorist attacks to lure the victim into decompressing. When the archive gets decompressed on the vulnerable computer, the embedded njRAT backdoor (Telegram Desktop.exe) will be extracted to the startup folder and then triggered into execution if the victim restarts the computer or performs re-login. After that, the attacker is capable to control the compromised device.

After conducting correlation analysis, we suspect the Goldmouse APT group (APT-C-27) may have a hand behind the attack. In addition, we discover multiple related Android samples that disguised as common applications to attack specific targets after performing further investigations. Considering the language being used in the malicious code is Arabic, it seems that the attacker is familiar with Arabic language as well.
