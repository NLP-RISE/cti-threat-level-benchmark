* text: Hackers have infected the systems of Altran Technologies with malware that spread through the company network, affecting operations in some European countries. To protect client data and their own assets, Altran decided to shut down its network and applications.

The attack occurred on January 24, but the French engineering consultancy released a public statement only yesterday and kept details to a bare minimum, saying that third-party technical experts and digital forensics specialists are on the case.
