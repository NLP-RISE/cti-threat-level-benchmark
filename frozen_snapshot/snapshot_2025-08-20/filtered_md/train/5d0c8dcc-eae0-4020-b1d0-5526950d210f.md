## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
### External analysis
* text: The Hide â€˜N Seek botnet was first discovered in January 2018 and is known for its unique use of Peer-to-Peer communication between bots.

Since its discovery, the malware family has seen a couple of upgrades, from the addition of persistence and new exploits, to targeting Android devices via the Android Debug Bridge (ADB).

This post details a variant of the family first seen on the 21st of February 2019, incorporating two new exploits â€“ CVE-2018-20062 which targets ThinkPHP installations, and CVE-2019-7238, a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager (NXRM) 3 software installations.

While the ThinkPHP exploit has already been seen employed by several Mirai variants, the only other instance of the CVE-2019-7238 vulnerability being exploited in the wild has been by the DDG botnet. Our research, outlined below, shows that the Hide â€˜N Seek botnet incorporated this exploit back in February 2019, even before the DDG botnet.
