* comment: As I've discussed before, EKs are merely a method to distribute malware.  Criminal groups establish campaigns utilizing EKs to distribute their malware.  I often see indicators of campaigns that use Magnitude EK or Rig EK to distribute Cerber ransomware.

In my lab environment, I generally don't generate much Magnitude EK.  Why?  Because Magnitude usually happens through a malvertising campaign, and that's quite difficult to replicate.  By the time any particular malvertisement's indicators are known, the criminals have moved to a new malvertisement.

Since early October 2016, I've typically seen Cerber ransomware from the pseudoDarkleech campaign using Rig EK.  PseudoDarkleech currently uses a variant of Rig EK that researcher Kafeine has designated as Rig-V, because it's a "vip" version that's evolved from the old Rig EK.

EITest is another major campaign that utilizes EKs to distribute malware.  Although EITest distributes a variety of malware, I'll occasionally see Cerber sent by this campaign.
