### report — Metadata used to generate an executive level report
* [External analysis] link: https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/09/tinyturla.html
* [Other] text: Cisco Talos found a previously undiscovered backdoor from the Turla APT that we are seeing in the wild. This simple backdoor is likely used as a second-chance backdoor to maintain access to the system, even if the primary malware is removed. It could also be used as a second-stage dropper to infect the system with additional malware.
