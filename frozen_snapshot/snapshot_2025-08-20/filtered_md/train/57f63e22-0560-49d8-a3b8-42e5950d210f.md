## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
### External analysis
* comment: Since posting about the DNC hack, each time we published a blog post on a BEAR-based topic we thought it was going to be our last. But like the Death Star’s gravitational pull, the story keeps drawing us back in as new information comes to light. Following our post on DCLeaks as a Russian influence operation, Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins reached out to us. Bellingcat, a group of citizen investigative journalists, has published articles critical of Russia and has been a key contributor to the international investigation of the shootdown of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) over Ukraine in 2014.

Higgins shared data with ThreatConnect that indicates Bellingcat has come under sustained targeting by Russian threat actors, which allowed us to identify a 2015 spearphishing campaign that is consistent with FANCY BEAR’s tactics, techniques, and procedures. We also analyzed a February 2016 attack by CyberBerkut — a group claiming to be pro-Russian Ukrainian hacktivists but also a suspected front for Moscow — against Russia-based Bellingcat contributor Ruslan Leviev, where CyberBerkut defaced the Bellingcat website and leaked Leviev’s personal details. As evidenced by these efforts and the attack on the World Anti-Doping Agency, organizations that negatively impact Russia’s image can expect Russian cyber operations intended to retaliate publicly or privately, influence, or otherwise maliciously affect them.
