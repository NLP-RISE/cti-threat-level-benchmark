### External analysis

* comment: In the last month Trustwave was engaged by two separate hospitality clients, and one restaurant chain for investigations by an unknown attacker or attackers. The modus operandi for all three investigations were very similar and appear to be a new Carbanak gang attack methodology, focused on the hospitality industry. Carbanak is a prolific crime group, well known for stealing over one billion dollars from banks in 2015 (*Kaspersky estimated loss) and more recently orchestrating an attack on the Oracle Micros POS support site that put over one million Point of Sale systems at risk. The current investigations are still underway but the known indicators of compromise in these new attacks will be presented below. At the time of investigation this malware was not correctly detected by any existing antivirus engines, and domains / IP's were not found in any commercial threat intelligence feeds.

It is also interesting to note that just during the time that it took to write this blog, Carbanak returned to their victims with significantly upgraded malware. This demonstrates the speed and versatility of this threat group. We have included analysis for two separate versions of AdobeUpdateManagementTool.vbs in this report. (The malware used following the initial infection) Version two arrived only two weeks after we began investigating this new campaign.
