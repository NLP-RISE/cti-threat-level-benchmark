### Other
* comment: ESET researchers collaborated with CERT-UA to analyze the attack against the Ukrainian energy company
* comment: The destructive actions were scheduled for 2022-04-08 but artifacts suggest that the attack had been planned for at least two weeks
* comment: The attack used ICS-capable malware and regular disk wipers for Windows, Linux and Solaris operating systems
* comment: We assess with high confidence that the attackers used a new version of the Industroyer malware, which was used in 2016 to cut power in Ukraine
* comment: We assess with high confidence that the APT group Sandworm is responsible for this new attack
* comment: Industroyer2 was deployed as a single Windows executable named 108_100.exe and executed using a scheduled task on 2022-04-08 at 16:10:00 UTC. It was compiled on 2022-03-23, according to the PE timestamp, suggesting that attackers had planned their attack for more than two weeks.
* comment: It contains a detailed configuration hardcoded in its body, driving the malware actions. This is different from Industroyer, stores configuration in a separate .INI file. Thus, attackers need to recompile Industroyer2 for each new victim or environment.
