* comment: Anti-detection features

These malware samples all employ a multi-stage architecture and encryption to stay under the radar.

After being downloaded and installed, these apps do not request any suspicious permissions and even mimic the activity the user expects them to exhibit.

Along with this, the malicious app also decrypts and executes its payload â€“ that is, the first-stage payload. This payload decrypts and executes the second-stage payload, which is stored in the assets of the initial app downloaded from Google Play. These steps are invisible to the user and serve as obfuscatory measures.

### Network activity
