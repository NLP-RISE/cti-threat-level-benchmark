* text: This report shares actionable threat intelligence and proven threat hunting and incident response methods used by the RSA Incident Response (IR) Team to successfully respond to an intrusion in early-to-mid 2017 by the threat actor group known as CARBANAK,  also known as FIN7. The methodology discussed in this report is designed, and has been tested, to be effective on several currently available security technologies. While the majority of examples shown in this document use the RSA NetWitness® Suite in their illustrations, the methodology, query logic, and behavioral indicators discussed can be used effectively with any security product providing the necessary visibility. The intrusion and response described in this paper highlight key behavioral tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) unique to this engagement, giving significant insight into the thought processes, preparation, and adaptive nature of actors within the CARBANAK threat actor group. This paper also illustrates the RSA Incident Response Team’s Incident Response and Threat Hunting Methodology: an unorthodox, adaptive and highly effective methodology used to successfully detect, investigate, scope, track, contain, and ultimately expel these and many other advanced adversaries.
