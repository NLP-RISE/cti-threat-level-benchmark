### Other
* comment: Phishing emails were sent using German-language lure content and bearing a logo from the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), a major political party in Germany.

The German-language lure document contains a phishing link directing victims to an actor-controlled compromised website hosting a malicious ZIP file containing a dropper. The dropper uses https://github.com/javascript-obfuscator/javascript-obfuscator and deliver a second-stage CDU-themed lure document and the next stage payload (WINELOADER).

The payload is decoded using Windows Certutil, then decompressed using tar. Finally, the legitimate Windows binary SqlDumper.exe is executed by the actor.
* comment: IOC from a blogpost presenting an analysis of a MOA SPIKEDWINE campaign. This campaign exploits geopolitical relations between India and European diplomats. It uses spearphishing in order to drop WINELOADER backdoor on compromised machine.
