## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
### External analysis
* text: When looking at malicious traffic, one of the things we are interested in are the hosts involved in a particular attack. For example, we check the hostnames or IP addresses that were serving up malicious code.

Before getting further, letâ€™s define a few concepts to better understand the topic we are discussing today. A host name can be:

A domain name (i.e. http://example.com/)
A fully qualified domain name (i.e. http://test.example.com/)
An IP address (i.e. http://127.0.0.1/)
Itâ€™s not as usual, but IP addresses can indeed be directly used as the URL and when that happens it is called an IP-Literal Hostname (see Eric Lawrenceâ€™s post on this subject).

IP addresses (IPv4) follow the dot-decimal notation which is four numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by dots. But then, to make things a little more complicated, we have exceptions, such as the non-dotted IP literals, in decimal (http://2130706433/) or octal form (http://017700000001/).

This takes us to a recent infection chain for the RIG exploit kit where we came across such an occurrence.
