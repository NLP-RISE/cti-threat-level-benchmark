* text: In a past article, we introduced TSCookie, malware which seems to be used by BlackTech[1]. It has been revealed that this actor also uses another type of malware â€œPLEADâ€. (â€œPLEADâ€ is referred to both as a name of malware including TSCookie and its attack campaign [2]. In this article, we refer to â€œPLEADâ€ as a type malware apart from TSCookie.) PLEAD has two kinds â€“ RAT (Remote Access Tool) and downloader. The RAT operates based on commands that are provided from C&C servers.ã€€(Please refer to a blog post from LAC for more information [3].) On the other hand, PLEAD downloader downloads modules and runs it on memory in the same way as TSCookie does.

This article presents behaviour of PLEAD downloader in detail.
