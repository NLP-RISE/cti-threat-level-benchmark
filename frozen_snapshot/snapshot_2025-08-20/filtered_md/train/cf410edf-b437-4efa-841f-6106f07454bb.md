### Other
* comment: Attended by people from all over the world, the WPL summit aims to improve gender equality in politics. Among the topics included in the 2023 Brussels conference were peace and security, war and oppression, disinformation, the war in Ukraine, the role of women in politics, and gender equality. Since many current and future political leaders had attended this conference, it presented an interesting target for espionage campaigns and served as a possible avenue for threat actors to gain an initial foothold in political organizations. It is therefore not surprising that Void Rabisu set up a campaign targeting WPL Summit 2023 attendees. Our telemetry provided concrete evidence that this campaign was aimed at targets working on gender equality in EU politics.
