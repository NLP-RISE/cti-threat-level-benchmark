* [Other] text: Reports of new 0-day vulnerabilities electrify the Cybersecurity community, especially when they affect commonly used products. Recent news about the successor of the infamous ProxyShell -CVE-2022-41040, CVE-2022-41082 – found in Microsoft Exchange and disclosed by researchers at GTSC Research Lab on 28/09/2022 pushed our TI operations to understand the attackers’ infrastructure better. Our brief analysis is evidence that it is worthwhile to do enrichment of available IOCs to build additional context and try to determine the motivations and origins of threat actors.
