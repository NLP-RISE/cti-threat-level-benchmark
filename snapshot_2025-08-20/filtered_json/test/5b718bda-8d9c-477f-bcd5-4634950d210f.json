Unfortunately, how the ransomware is being distributed is unknown at this time.\r\n\r\nNot much is known regarding how this ransomware is being distributed other than what people have posted in the BleepingComputer forums. According to some of the posts, the ransomware appeared after the user downloaded and installed cracks such as KMSpico. Other reports state that it appeared on its own and that the victim did not install anything.",
