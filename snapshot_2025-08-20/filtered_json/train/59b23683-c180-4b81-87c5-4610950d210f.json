A few days ago I got a message on Facebook from a person I very rarely speak to, and I knew that something fishy was going on.\r\n\r\nAfter just a few minutes analyzing the message, I understood that I was just peeking at the top of this iceberg. This malware was spreading via Facebook Messenger, serving multi platform malware/adware, using tons of domains to prevent tracking, and earning clicks. The code is advanced and obfuscated.",
