A week later, Kaspersky Lab analysts managed to detect a malicious program for Windows that was apparently created by the same group responsible for SambaCry. It was the common C&C server that both programs used â€“ cl.ezreal.space:20480 â€“ that suggested a relationship between them.\r\n\r\nKaspersky Lab products detect the new malicious program as Backdoor.Win32.CowerSnail. MD5: 5460AC43725997798BAB3EB6474D391F\r\n\r\nCowerSnail was compiled using Qt and linked with various libraries. This framework provides benefits such as cross-platform capability and transferability of the source code between different operating systems. This, however, has an effect on the resulting file size: the user code ends up as a small proportion of a large 3 MB file.",
