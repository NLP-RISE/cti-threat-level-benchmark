During the brief time it was live, users accessing the malicious page from Internet Explorer (versions 3 to 11) would have become the unwilling hosts for the infostealer payload without any security warning. After we alerted Google about its presence, they quickly cleaned it and the original URL involved in propagation also went down.",
