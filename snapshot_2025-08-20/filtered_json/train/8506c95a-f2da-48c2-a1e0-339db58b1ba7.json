The RAR contains a Microsoft Shortcut (LNK) file which executes a Portable Executable (PE) file contained in a hidden folder named “_MACOSX”.\r\n\r\nFollowing execution, the target is shown a decoy document related to BGP Flapping, and the executable file uses indirect syscalls to load shellcode into memory before it deletes itself from disk.\r\n\r\nWe are raising early awareness of this campaign given the coordinated effort to target network infrastructure administration personnel across a broad range of AS owners.\r\n\r\nIOCs for this campaign:\r\n\r\n4ec4b396bfa932756c90833e781f95c07b15108526a9c218efb35526ad956535 (Detailed explanation of as relationships and the impact of bgp flapping on upstream networks.rar)\r\n\r\n12031213e31dca91eddc9d4a16d2e2c18da9fb355ee98dc4acbbaa16e35faec3 (Detailed explanation of as relationships and the impact of bgp flapping on upstream networks.lnk)\r\n\r\nafc971f687303d0b3f3699883aa428f885d0a3fc20576953a28d31844328ccda (Adobe PDF Extractor.exe)\r\n\r\nActor-controlled sender domain:\r\nswisscoms[.]com\r\n\r\nC2 domain: onnetmais[.]org (behind Cloudflare CDN)\r\nBackend C2 IP address: 47.251.162[.]130",
