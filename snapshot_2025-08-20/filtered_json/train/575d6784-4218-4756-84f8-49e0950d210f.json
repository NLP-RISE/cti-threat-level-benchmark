PhishMe and Dr.Web have since added some additional insight into the family. Browsing through a memory dump of the malware, a Webinjects section sticks out. Webinjects usually imply banking malware, so it seems Bolek picks up where its predecessor, Carberp, leaves off. This post takes a closer look at its command and control (C2) mechanism and what it takes to elicit a configuration file from its C2 servers.",
