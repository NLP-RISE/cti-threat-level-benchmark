### External analysis
* text: As cybercriminals start to focus on pulling off attacks without leaving a trace, fileless malware, such as the recent SOREBRECT ransomware, will become a more common attack method. However, many of these malware are fileless only while entering a userâ€™s system, as they eventually reveal themselves when they execute their payload. Attacks that use completely fileless malware are a rare occurrence, so we thought it important to discuss a new trojan known as JS_POWMET (Detected by Trend Micro as JS_POWMET.DE), which arrives via an autostart registry procedure. By utilizing a completely fileless infection chain, the malware will be more difficult to analyze using a sandbox, making it more difficult for anti-malware engineers to examine.

Initial reports from our Smart Protection Network (SPN) data reveals JS_POWMET affecting APAC the most, with almost 90% of the infections coming from the region.
