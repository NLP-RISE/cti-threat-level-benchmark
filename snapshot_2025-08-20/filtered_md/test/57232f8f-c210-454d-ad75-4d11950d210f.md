### External analysis
* comment: The FortiGuard Virtualization Execution X (VEX) system â€“ a behaviour-based, in-house framework designed to identify zero-day samples â€“ has detected a previously undiscovered iteration of the BlackMoon Trojan.

BlackMoon Trojan is a banking trojan that is designed to phish user credentials from various South Korean banking institutions. It was discovered in early 2014 and was named after a debug string, â€œBlackMoonâ€, that was present in its code.

While the BlackMoon malware code has been constantly updated by its perpetrators, the extent of the campaign's infection is previously unknown. This post intends to share the findings of the FortiGuard Lion Team on BlackMoonâ€™s prevalence and its latest code updates.
