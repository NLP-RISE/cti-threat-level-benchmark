### External analysis

* text: Since mid-2016 we have observed multiple new samples of the Android Adware family â€œEwindâ€. The actors behind this adware utilize a simple yet effective approach â€“ they download a popular, legitimate Android application, decompile it, add their malicious routines, then repackage the Android application package (APK). They then distribute the trojanized application using their own, Russian-language-targeted Android Application sites.

Some of the popular Android applications that Ewind targets include GTA Vice City, AVG cleaner, Minecraft â€“ Pocket Edition, Avast! Ransomware Removal, VKontakte, and Opera Mobile.

Although Ewind is fundamentally adware, monetization through displaying advertising on the victim device, it also includes other functionality such as collecting device data, and forwarding SMS messages to the attacker. The adware Trojan in fact potentially allows full remote access to the infected device.

The applications, injected advertising, application sites â€“ and, we believe, the attacker, are all Russian.
