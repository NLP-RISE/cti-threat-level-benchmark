* comment: Banking Trojans work by injecting code into web pages as they are viewed on infected machines, allowing the malware to harvest banking credentials and credit card information as victims interact with legitimate sites. Most often, the injects -- the code that actually performs the man-in-the-browser attacks -- are configured for region-specific banking sites. More recently, we have seen injects for online payment sites, casinos, retailers, and more appearing in banking Trojan campaigns.

Since November -- a period of time that includes Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Cyber Monday and now leading up to Christmas -- we have observed Zeus Panda banking Trojan campaigns that have an increasing focus on non-banking targets with an extensive list of injects clearly designed to capitalize on holiday shopping and activities.

More specifically, these Zeus Panda (aka Panda Banker) campaigns expanded their injects to a variety of online shopping sites for brick and mortar retailers like Zara, specialty online retailers, travel sites, and video streaming sites, among others. The vast majority of these new targets will potentially see higher-than-normal numbers of credit card transactions for the holidays. While Zeus Panda can be configured to steal a variety of information, these injects collected the credit card number, address, phone number, DOB, SSN, and security question-related information such as motherâ€™s maiden name.
