* text: leakedsourceonline@gmail.com — I sought an interview by reaching out to the email listed on the site (leakedsourceonline@gmail.com).
* threat-actor: Jeremy Wade — This is in reference to a pseudonym Xerx3s frequently used, â€œJeremy Wade.â€
* text: imjeremywade@gmail.com
* text: +12313430295 — The Gmail account xdavros@gmail.com was used to register at least four domain names almost six years ago in 2011. Two of those domains â€” daily-streaming.com and tiny-chats.com â€” were originally registered to a â€œNick Davrosâ€ at 3757 Dunes Parkway, Muskegon, Mich. The other two were registered to a Nick or Alex Davros at 868 W. Hile Rd., Muskegon, Mich. All four domain registration records included the phone number +12313430295.

### External analysis

* comment: Late last month, multiple news outlets reported that unspecified law enforcement officials had seized the servers for Leakedsource.com, perhaps the largest online collection of usernames and passwords leaked or stolen in some of the worst data breaches â€” including billions of credentials for accounts at top sites like LinkedIn, Myspace, and Yahoo.

In a development that could turn out to be deeply ironic, it seems that the real-life identity of LeakedSourceâ€™s principal owner may have been exposed by many of the same stolen databases heâ€™s been peddling.
