### External analysis
* link: https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/spotlight-on-shamoon/
* text: All of the initial analysis pointed to Shamoon emerging in the Middle East.  There were a number of similarities that we highlighted in our earlier blogs (on McAfee.com). This however was not the end of the story since the campaign continues to target organizations in the Middle East from a variety of verticals. Indeed reports suggested that a further 15 â€˜Shamoon incidentsâ€™ had been reported from public to private sector.
