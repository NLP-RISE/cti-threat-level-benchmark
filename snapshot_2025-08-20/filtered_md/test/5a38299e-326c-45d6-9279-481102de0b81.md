## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
### External analysis
* text: On September 6, Symantec published details of the Dragonfly campaign, which targeted dozens of energy companies throughout 2017. This attack was effectively Dragonfly 2.0, an update to a campaign that began in 2014.

Moving beyond our 2014 analysis of Dragonfly, our current focus looks at the attackâ€™s indicators to determine whether we can glean any further information regarding the source and possible motivations of those behind the campaign. The campaign targets energy companies around the world by leveraging spear-phishing emails that, once successful, allow the attackers to download Trojan software. The Trojans provide access to the victimsâ€™ systems and networks.
