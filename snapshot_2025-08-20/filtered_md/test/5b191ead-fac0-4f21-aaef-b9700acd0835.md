* url: http://clodflarechk.com/1.dat — Once the victim double-clicks the attachment, it downloads a file named "2.dat" from clodflarechk[.]com. 2.dat is a Powershell script that downloads a file named "1.dat" from the same network resource.

1.dat is another script file that downloads a file named "data.xls" from the same network resource. Although the extension is ".xls," it is not an Excel file but rather an executable file that functions as a malware downloader.

Once executed on the system, data.xls downloads a file named "cloud.png" from the same network resource. Cloud.png is not a graphic file as the extension suggests, but rather it is the main malware installed on the system. The main malware functions as a remote access Trojan (RAT) that gives attackers control of the compromised system.
