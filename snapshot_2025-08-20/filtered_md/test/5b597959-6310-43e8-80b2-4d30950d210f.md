## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
### External analysis
* text: The Kronos banking Trojan was first discovered in 2014 and was a steady fixture in the threat landscape for a few years before largely disappearing. Now a new variant has appeared, with at least three distinct campaigns targeting Germany, Japan, and Poland respectively, to date.

In April 2018, the first samples of a new variant of the banking Trojan appeared in the wild. The most notable new feature is that the command and control (C&C) mechanism has been refactored to use the Tor anonymizing network. There is some speculation and circumstantial evidence suggesting that this new version of Kronos has been rebranded â€œOsirisâ€ and is being sold on underground markets. In this blog, we present information on the German, Japanese, and Polish campaigns as well as a fourth campaign that looks to be a work in progress and still being tested.
