### Other
* comment: Interestingly, the actors made no significant changes in the core of their modular backdoor in the seven years after its discovery in 2014 by Kaspersky and Symantec. As described in the aforementioned reports, we observed multiple samples of Cloud Atlasâ€™ modular backdoor. Each is an obfuscated DLL accompanied by an encrypted file, with both DLL and data files named using random words. For example, a DLL named beachmaster.dll was accompanied by an encrypted file named examinere. Each DLL has multiple randomly-named export functions, only one of which is relevant. When the relevant export function is called, the DLL begins to decrypt and load an embedded PE file. The loaded PE file then XOR-decrypts a hardcoded struct that instructs it how to decrypt the companion file.
