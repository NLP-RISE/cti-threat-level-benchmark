### Other
* comment: According to IBM X-Force Research, Dridex configurations from the past two months are replete with a hefty count of targets in some more common countries, such as the U.S., U.K., Canada and Australia. However, the Trojan is targeting some less charted territories as well, such as Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Lebanon and Ukraine, to name a few. This is quite uncommon for any banking Trojan.

Per its configuration files, Dridex currently targets over 20 Latvian banks, three banks in Estonia, three in Lithuania and one in Ukraine, among its other uncommon choices of late.
