* text: Exploit kits may be down, but theyâ€™re not out. While theyâ€™re still using the same techniques that involve malvertisements or embedding links in spam and malicious or compromised websites, their latest activities are making them significant factors in the threat landscape again. This is the case with Rig and GrandSoft, as well as the private exploit kit Magnitude â€” exploit kits we found roping in relatively recent vulnerabilities to deliver cryptocurrency-mining malware, ransomware, botnet loaders, and banking trojans.

Based on the exploit kitsâ€™ latest activities, it appears they and their users are shifting tactics by joining the bandwagon, like capitalizing on cryptocurrencyâ€™s popularity or using off-the-rack malware. We expect this to be the status quo this year, given the profitability of using cryptocurrency miners and the convenience of using ready-made malware. We also foresee more exploits that work on other software, such as  CVE-2018-8174, which can be exploited via Microsoft Word and Internet Explorer.
