* text: A new twist in the scam extortion emails is a new email campaign originating from Russia that contains a bomb threat stating they will detonate a bomb if the recipient does not send a $20,000 USD bitcoin payment.

There are reports of these emails being received throughout the U.S.A and contain subject lines similar to "My device is inside your building", "No need to be heroic", or "Rescue service will complicate the situation".

These emails then proceed to state that a mercenary created an explosive device made of "lead azide", "trinitrotoluene" [sic], or some other material and has placed it in the recipient's building. It goes on to further state that if the recipient does not pay a $20,000 USD bitcoin payment, the device will be detonated by the end of the day.

### email — Email object describing an email with meta-information
* [Payload delivery] email-body: I write you to inform you that my man has hidden the bomb (tronitrotoluene) in the building where your company is located. My mercenary built a bomb according to my instructions. It is compact and it is hidden very carefully, it is impossible to destroy the structure of the building by my bomb, but in the case of its detonation there will be many wounded people.
My mercenary is controlling the situation around the building. If he sees any strange activity or cops he will blow up the device.
I can call off my mercenary if you make a transfer. You pay me 20'000 usd in Bitcoin and explosive will not detonate, but do not try to fool me -I assure you that I have to call off my recruited person solely after 3 confirmations in blockchain. 

My payment details (Bitcoin address): 1P3cNFy3SdfZ8PvMSdgLRcb2TtaLvxfqat

You must pay me by the end of the working day. If the workday is over and people start leaving the building explosive will explode.
Nothing personal this is just a business, if I do not receive the bitcoins and the explosive device detonates, next time other commercial enterprises will send me more money, because it is not an isolated case.
To stay anonimous I will not enter this email account. I check my Bitcoin address every forty min and after seeing the money I will order my person to get away.

If an explosion occurred and the authorities read this letter!
We are not terrorists and dont take any  responsibility for acts of terrorism in other buildings.
