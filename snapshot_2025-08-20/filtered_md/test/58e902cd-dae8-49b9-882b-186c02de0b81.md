* text: During a security conference held on 4 April 2017, Kaspersky Lab revealed details of an attack in which attackers took control of dozens of domains owned by a Brazilian bank and leveraged this access to deliver malware and phishing pages to users. Our identification and analysis of the malware used in this campaign determined that it is a Java-based downloader that acquires and extracts a zip file from an IP address under the control of the attackers.

This zip contains several additional files, including a legitimate rootkit removal executable, a malicious DLL file, a text file used by the rootkit removal tool to delete antivirus programs, and a batch file used to leverage these files to install the malicious payload. Through further research, Cyber4Sight determined that this infection method dates back to at least 2009, but shared tools, techniques, and procedures (TTP) identified in other public sandbox reports suggest that the actor responsible for this attack likely continued their operations through April of this year.
