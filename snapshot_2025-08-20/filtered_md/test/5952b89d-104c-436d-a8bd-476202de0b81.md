### External analysis
* text: The Petya outbreak recorded on 27 June 2017 has had a significant impact on a number of global organisations, with media outlets reporting impacts as significant as the cessation of activity at the Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands [1].

While many may be loath to think back six weeks to the trauma of Mayâ€™s WannaCry outbreak (https://blogs.forcepoint.com/security-labs/wannacry-post-outbreak-analysis), there are a number of parallels between the two incidents ranging from the global reach of the outbreak to the techniques by which the malware is spread.
