### External analysis
* link: https://asert.arbornetworks.com/lojack-becomes-a-double-agent/
* text: ASERT recently discovered Lojack agents containing malicious C2s. These hijacked agents pointed to suspected Fancy Bear (a.k.a. APT28, Pawn Storm) domains.  The InfoSec community and the U.S. government have both attributed Fancy Bear activity to Russian espionage activity.  Fancy Bear actors typically choose geopolitical targets, such as governments and international organizations. They also target industries that do business with such organizations, such as defense contractors.  Lojack, formally known as Computrace, is a legitimate laptop recovery solution used by a number of companies to protect their assets should they be stolen.  Lojack makes an excellent double-agent due to appearing as legit software while natively allowing remote code execution. Although the initial intrusion vector for this activity remains unknown, Fancy Bear often utilizes phishing email to deliver payloads.
