* comment: Not long after a new strain of the Akuma malware was discovered targeting ZyXEL devices with a new series of login/password attacks, FortiGuard Labs last week also began detecting strange scanning activities on uncommon TCP ports 52869 and 37215. We and other threat research teams quickly began to suspect that these were tied together, and that there was a new botnet out there.

With some focused research, the new Satori botnet, or â€œOkiruâ€ â€“ as it was named by its malevolent author â€“ came to light. Okiru is a Japanese word that can be translated to â€œto get upâ€ or â€œto riseâ€. Okiru first appeared on our radar at the end of October 2017, but during the first week of December it significantly stepped up its game by also adding worm capabilities to its arsenal. I will break down our analysis of this new botnet strain in this report.
