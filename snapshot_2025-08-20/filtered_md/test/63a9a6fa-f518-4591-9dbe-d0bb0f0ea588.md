* [Other] text: For a few days, "Follina" is generating a lot of noise on the Internet, check our yesterday diary[1] about this new vulnerability if you need more details. It was time to hunt for some samples. For this purpose, I created a simple YARA rule on VT:

### yara — An object describing a YARA rule (or a YARA rule name) along with its version.
* [Other] text: all
* [Payload installation] yara: import "vt"
rule hunt_0day_msdt
{
    strings:
        $s1 = "!\" TargetMode=\"External\"/>" nocase wide ascii
    condition:
        new_file and all of ($s*) and vt.metadata.file_type == vt.FileType.DOCX
}
