* comment: A new ransomware was discovered this week by MalwareHunterTeam called Black Ruby. This ransomware will encrypt the files on a computer, scramble the file name, and then append the BlackRuby extension. To make matters worse, Black Ruby will also install a Monero miner on the computer that utilizes as much of the CPU as it can.

Unfortunately, this ransomware is not decryptable at this time. If you wish to discuss or receive help, you can use our dedicated Black Ruby Help & Support topic.
