* [Other] text: On April 24, 2025, SAP disclosed CVE-2025-31324, a critical vulnerability with a CVSS score of 10.0 affecting the SAP NetWeaver's Visual Composer Framework, version 7.50. This threat brief shares a brief overview of the vulnerability and our analysis, and also includes details of what we’ve observed through our incident response services and telemetry.

This vulnerability allows unauthenticated users to upload arbitrary files to an SAP NetWeaver application server, leading to potential remote code execution (RCE) and full system compromise. Exploitation is achieved by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the /developmentserver/metadatauploader endpoint. We have observed attackers leveraging this vulnerability to deploy web shells (e.g., helper.jsp and cache.jsp) for persistent access and subsequent command execution.

In our incident response cases and telemetry, we observed attackers exploiting this vulnerability to deploy, for example, reverse shell tools and a reverse SSH SOCKS proxy using a variety of network infrastructure.

We recommend that users of SAP NetWeaver refer to official documentation and instructions from SAP for guidance.
