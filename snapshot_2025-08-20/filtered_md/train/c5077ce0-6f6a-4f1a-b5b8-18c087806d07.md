### Other
* comment: This STIX file provides updated list of indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with malicious activity reported in CISA Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA), AA22-138B, pertaining to Threat Actors Chaining VMware Vulnerabilities for Full System Control. 

The original CSA AA22-138B was published on May 18, 2022. 

On June 2, 2022, CSA AA22-138B has been updated with additional indicators of compromise (IOCs), detection signatures, as well as tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) obtained from trusted third parties.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is releasing this CSA to warn organizations that malicious cyber actors, likely advanced persistent threat (APT) actors, are exploiting CVE-2022-22954 and CVE 2022-22960 separately and in combination. 

VMware released updates for both vulnerabilities on April 6, 2022, and, according to a trusted third party, malicious cyber actors were able to reverse engineer the updates to develop an exploit within 48 hours and quickly began exploiting the disclosed vulnerabilities in unpatched devices. CISA was made aware of this exploit a week later and added CVE-2022-22954 and CVE-2022-22960 to its catalog of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities on April 14 and April 15, respectively. 

Based on this activity, CISA expects malicious cyber actors to quickly develop a capability to exploit newly released vulnerabilities CVE-2022-22972 and CVE-2022-22973 in the same impacted VMware products.
