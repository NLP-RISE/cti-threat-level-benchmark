* text: Banking Trojans continue to evolve and threat actors are using them in new ways, even as the massive Dridex campaigns of 2015 have given way to ransomware and other payloads. Most recently, we observed several relatively large email campaigns distributing the Kronos banking Trojan. In these campaigns, though, Kronos acted as a loader with a new Point-of-Sale (POS) malware dubbed ScanPOS as the secondary payload.
