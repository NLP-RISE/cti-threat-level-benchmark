### Other
* comment: On May 16, 2023, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) published this joint Cybersecurity Advisory. The advisory aims to disseminate the latest information on the known BianLian ransomware and data extortion group IOCs and TTPs, which were identified through FBI and ACSC investigations as of March 2023.

BianLian is a ransomware operation that first appeared in the wild in July 2022, successfully breaching multiple high-profile organizations. The group has also targeted multiple American as well as Australian critical infrastructure sectors.

This STIX file provides indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with malicious activity reported in CISA Joint Cybersecurity Advisory, "AA23-136A StopRansomware BianLian Ransomware Group." — Imported from STIX header description
* comment: BianLian is a ransomware developer, deployer, and data extortion cybercriminal group that has targeted organizations in multiple U.S. critical infrastructure sectors since June 2022. They have also targeted Australian critical infrastructure sectors in addition to professional services and property development.
* comment: The group gains access to victim systems through valid Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials, uses open-source tools and command-line scripting for discovery and credential harvesting, and exfiltrates victim data via File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Rclone, or Mega. BianLian group actors then extort money by threatening to release data if payment is not made.
* comment: BianLian group originally employed a double-extortion model in which they encrypted victims’ systems after exfiltrating the data; however, around January 2023, they shifted to primarily exfiltration-based extortion.
