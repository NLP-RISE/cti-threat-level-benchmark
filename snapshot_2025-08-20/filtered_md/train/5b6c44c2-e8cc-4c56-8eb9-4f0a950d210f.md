* text: In January 2018, a Tibetan activist received a mundane-looking email purporting to be program updates from a human rights NGO. Attached to the message were a PowerPoint presentation and a document. The activist, like many in the Tibetan diaspora, had grown wary of unsolicited emails with attachments, and instead of opening the documents, shared the files with Citizen Lab researchers.

The suspicion was warranted: the attachments were malicious. If clicked, the files would run recent exploits to infect Windows computers with custom malware. This email was the start of a malware campaign active between January to March 2018 that targeted Tibetan activists, journalists, members of the Tibetan Parliament in exile, and the Central Tibetan Administration. We worked closely with the targeted groups to collect the malicious messages, and also engaged in incident response with a compromised organization. This collaboration enabled us to gain further insights into the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by the operators.

The campaign used social engineering to trick targets into opening exploit-laden PowerPoint (CVE-2017-0199) and Microsoft Rich Text Format (RTF) documents (CVE-2017-11882) attached to e-mail messages. The malware includes a PowerShell payload we call DMShell++, a backdoor known as TSSL, and a post-compromise tool we call DSNGInstaller.

We call this recent campaign the â€œResurfaced Campaignâ€ because of connections to a 2016 campaign that targeted Tibetan Parliamentarians (which we refer to as the â€œParliamentary Campaignâ€). These connections suggest that the same group may be involved or tools and infrastructure are being shared between multiple groups.
