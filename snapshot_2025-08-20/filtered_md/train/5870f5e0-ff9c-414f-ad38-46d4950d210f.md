* comment: We recently encountered an atypical case of Sundown EK in the wild â€“ usually the landing page is obfuscated, but in this case there was plain JavaScript. The exploit was dropping some malicious payloads that we took for further analysis. It turned out that they are also atypical by many means. In this article, we will describe the details of our investigation.

### Social network
* github-username: lovemonero — The name of the user â€“ LoveMonero â€“ suggests that this application is not used to mine Bitcoins, but another cryptocurrency â€“ Monero. This choice makes sense, because the pool of bitcoins is more and more saturated â€“ and nowadays mining them is much more difficult  and resource-consuming than it was in the past, when this currency was still young.
