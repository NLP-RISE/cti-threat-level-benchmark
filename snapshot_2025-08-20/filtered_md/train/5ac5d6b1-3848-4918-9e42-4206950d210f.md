* comment: Today MalwareHunterTeam discovered a new variant of the Cryptomix Ransomware that appends the .MOLE66 extension to encrypted files, changes the contact email, and slightly changes the ransom note's name. In the past, we used to see new Cryptomix variants a few times a month, but this time it has been almost 2 months since the previous System variant was released.
