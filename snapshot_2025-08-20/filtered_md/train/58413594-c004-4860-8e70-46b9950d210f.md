* comment: PBot is a remote IRC Protocol Bot for usually used for taking over the infected machine into network malicious tool for PortScanning, DoS + etc acts.
It has been a long time for analyzing an active PBot, our previous post abut Pbot are here>>http://malwaremustdie.blogspot.jp/2012/09/cracking-of-strong-encrypted-phpirc-bot.html. This new one just spotted accidentally in my watch this new year. I trailed back infection started from before Christmas and noted its activities until yesterday. There's nothing special about this infection instead the ignorance of the domain owner which I informed him by severeal times, without getting response nor removal act.
This PBot is a plain textual script, camouflage its filename with a JPEG file extension, yes it contains some severe malicious functionalities of PBot which people should know about.
