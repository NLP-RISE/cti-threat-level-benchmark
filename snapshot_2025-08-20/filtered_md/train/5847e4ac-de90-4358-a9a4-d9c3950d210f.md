* comment: Recently, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, also known as MUNI, was attacked by a new variant of Mamba (a.k.a HDDCryptor) – a disk-encypting ransomware. The incident left their ticketing services with inoperational systems and a note that read, “You Hacked,ALL Data Encrypted,Contact For Key(cryptom27@yandex.com)”

Fortinet first discovered Mamba two months ago. Since then, it has been under the radar – until this big attack. We will now take a look at a few irregularities and some new developments it has employed over the past few months.
