* comment: As if encrypting files and holding them hostage is not enough, cybercriminals who create and spread crypto-ransomware are now resorting to causing blue screen of death (BSoD) and putting their ransom notes at system startupâ€”as in, even before the operating system loads. Imagine turning on your computer and instead of the usual Windows icon loading, you get a flashing red and white screen with a skull-and-crossbones instead.

This is the routine of a new crypto-ransomware variant dubbed â€œPetyaâ€ (detected by Trend Micro as RANSOM_PETYA.A). Not only does this malware have the ability to overwrite the affected systemâ€™s master boot record (MBR) in order to lock users out, it is also interesting to note that it is delivered to victims via a legitimate cloud storage service (in this case, via Dropbox).

We do note that this isnâ€™t the first time that malware has abused a legitimate service for its own gain; however, this is the first time (in a long time) that leads to crypto-ransomware infection. It is also a departure from the typical infection chain, wherein the malicious files are attached to emails or hosted in malicious sites and delivered by exploit kits.
