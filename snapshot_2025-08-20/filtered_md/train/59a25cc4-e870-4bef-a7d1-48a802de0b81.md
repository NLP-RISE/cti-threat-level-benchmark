### External analysis
* text: Last week, the Ukrainian Central Bank issued a warning around an attack being launched against Ukrainian banks. Thanks to one of our contacts in the region, we received the malware at an early stage and were able to provide coverage for our customersâ€”always our first priority. Now that local authorities have publicly disclosed the matter, we would like to share some insights into the campaign.

The attacks appear to have targeted banks in Russia as well as Ukraine, and we are aware of reports of similar attack vectors and payloads in other countries.

The initial threat started with emails sent to the banks around August 10, 2017, and a second wave on August 18 that carried attachments containing a payload. The subject of the emails were triggered to get the attention of the users and lure them into opening the attachments.
