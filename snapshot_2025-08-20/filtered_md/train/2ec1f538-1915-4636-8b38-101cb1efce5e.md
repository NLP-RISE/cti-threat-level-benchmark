* comment: This STIX file provides indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with malicious activity reported in CISA joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA), A22-108A TraderTraitor North Korean State-Sponsored APT Targets Blockchain Companies. 

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and CISA, and the U.S. Treasury Department (Treasury) are issuing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to highlight the cyber threat associated with cryptocurrency thefts and tactics used by a North Korean state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) group since at least 2020. This group is commonly tracked by the cybersecurity industry as Lazarus Group, APT38, BlueNoroff, and Stardust Chollima.

The U.S. government has observed North Korean cyber actors targeting a variety of organizations in the blockchain technology and cryptocurrency industry, including cryptocurrency exchanges, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, play-to-earn cryptocurrency video games, cryptocurrency trading companies, venture capital funds investing in cryptocurrency, and individual holders of large amounts of cryptocurrency or valuable non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The activity described in this advisory involves social engineering of victims using a variety of communication platforms to 
encourage individuals to download trojanized cryptocurrency applications on Windows or macOS operating systems. — Imported from STIX header description
