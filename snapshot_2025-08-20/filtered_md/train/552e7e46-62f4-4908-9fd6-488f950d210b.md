### Payload delivery
* comment: The â€œDragonOKâ€ group in particular is known
to use password-protected documents
delivered as attachments in emails, with the
password listed in the contents of the email.
This method probably is used to evade
detection by AV software, gateway firewalls
and malware sandboxes. One such example
using the password â€œ888888â€ is shown in
Figure 2 and Figure 6, and has been observed
by FireEye7 before. Another similar sample
was referenced by the â€œcontagioâ€ blog8 and
used the password â€œ8861â€.
