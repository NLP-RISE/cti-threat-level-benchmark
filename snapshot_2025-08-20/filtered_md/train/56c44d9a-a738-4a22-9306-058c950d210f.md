* comment: Proofpoint researchers have discovered a new ransomware named "Locky" being distributed via MS Word documents with malicious macros. While a variety of new ransomware has appeared since the end of 2015, Locky stands out because it is being delivered by the same actor behind many of the Dridex campaigns we have tracked over the last year.
