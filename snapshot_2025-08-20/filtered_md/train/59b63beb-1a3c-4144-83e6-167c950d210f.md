* comment: A malware group is using Facebook's CDN servers to store malicious files that it later uses to infect users with banking trojans.

Researchers spotted several campaigns using Facebook's CDN servers in the last two weeks, and previously, the same group also used Dropbox and Google's cloud storage services to store the same malicious payloads.

The previous attacks that used Google and Dropbox URLs were documented by Palo Alto's Brad Duncan in a July write-up, and are almost identical to the ones detected last week by security researcher MalwareHunter.

The group uses Facebook's CDN because the domain is trusted by most security solutions and there are low chances of having it blocked, compared to hosting malware on domains rarely active inside a business network.
