## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
### External analysis

* text: The Sednit group — also known as Strontium, APT28, Fancy Bear or Sofacy — is a group of attackers operating since 2004, if not earlier, and whose main objective is to steal confidential information from specific targets.

This article is a follow-up to ESET’s presentation at BlueHat in November 2017. Late in 2016 we published a white paper covering Sednit activity between 2014 and 2016. Since then, we have continued to actively track Sednit’s operations, and today we are publishing a brief overview of what our tracking uncovered in terms of the group’s activities and updates to their toolset. The first section covers the update of their attack methodology: namely, the ways in which this group tries to compromise their targets systems. The second section covers the evolution of their tools, with a particular emphasis on a detailed analysis of a new version of their flagship malware: Xagent.
