* comment: ZooPark is a cyberespionage operation that has been focusing on Middle Eastern targets since at least June 2015. The threat actors behind ZooPark infect Android devices using several generations of malware we label from v1-v4, with v4 being the most recent version deployed in 2017.

The preferred infection vector for ZooPark is waterhole attacks. We found several news websites that have been hacked by the attackers to redirect visitors to a downloading site that serves malicious APKs. Some of the themes observed in campaign include â€œKurdistan referendumâ€, â€œTelegramGroupsâ€ and â€œAlnaharegypt newsâ€, among others. 

Target profile has evolved during the last years of campaign, focusing on victims in Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Lebanon.
