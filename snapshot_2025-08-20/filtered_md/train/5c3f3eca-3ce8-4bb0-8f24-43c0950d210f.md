* text: While reviewing some network anomalies, we recently uncovered Cold River, a sophisticated threat actor making malicious use of DNS tunneling for command and control activities. We have been able to decode the raw traffic in command and control, find sophisticated lure documents used in the campaign, connect other previously unknown samples, and associate a number of legitimate organizations whose infrastructure is referenced and used in the campaign.

The campaign targets Middle Eastern organizations largely from the Lebanon and United Arab Emirates, though, Indian and Canadian companies with interests in those Middle Eastern countries are also targeted. There are new TTPs used in this attack â€“ for example Agent_Drable is leveraging the Django python framework for command and control infrastructure, the technical details of which are outlined later in the blog.

### Network activity
* domain: 0ffice36o.com — callback domain
* ip-dst: 185.161.211.72 — Hardcoded HTTP CnC, not used at the time of the analysis.
* hostname: crzugfdhsmrqgq4hy000.0ffice36o.com — DNS queries from different victims
* hostname: gyc3gfmhomrqgq4hy.0ffice36o.com — DNS queries from different victims

* ip-dst: 185.20.187.8 — Mostly used to generate Letâ€™s Encrypt certificates. Port 443 still answers with memail.mea.com[.]lb. Port 444 has a â€œGlobalSignâ€ certificate of memail.mea.com[.]lb.
* hostname: memail.mea.com.lb
* ip-dst: 185.20.184.138 — Live HTTP CnC. Ports 80 and 443 return interesting Django debug info.
