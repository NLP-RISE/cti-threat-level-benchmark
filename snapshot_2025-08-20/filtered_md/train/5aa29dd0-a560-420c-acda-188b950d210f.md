* comment: Last week, security firm Bitdefender, the Romanian Police, and Europol allegedly gained access to the GandCrab Ransomware's Command & Control servers, which allowed them to recover some of the victim's decryption keys. This allowed Bitdefender to release a tool that could decrypt some victim's files.

After this breach, the GandCrab developers stated that they would release a second version of GandCrab that included a more secure command & control server in order to prevent a similar compromise in the future.

Yesterday, MalwareHunterTeam discovered that GandCrab version 2 was released, which contains changes that supposedly make it more secure and allow us to differentiate it from the original version. In this article we will provide a quick overview as to what has changed and how you can identify that you are are infected with the GandCrab Ransomware.
