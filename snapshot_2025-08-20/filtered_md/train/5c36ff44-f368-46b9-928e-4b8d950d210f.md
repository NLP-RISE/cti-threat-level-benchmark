* text: With people becoming more aware of ransomware, criminals are coming up with some pretty low life schemes in order to coerce victims into paying ransomware. Such is the case with a CryptoMix ransomware, who pretends to represent a sick children's charity and is asking for a ransom payment as if it was a charitable donation.

CryptoMix pretending to be a children's charity is not new, but this latest iteration is taking it to the next level of depravity by including stories and information taken from legitimate crowdfunding pages for sick children.
