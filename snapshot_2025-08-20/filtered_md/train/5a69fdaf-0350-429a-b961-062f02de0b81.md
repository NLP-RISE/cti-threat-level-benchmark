* text: Malicious spam (malspam) pushing Hancitor malware (also known as Chanitor or Tordal) has been somewhat quiet since its last wave of 2017 on December 21st.  During the holidays, Hancitor took a break.  And in the first three weeks of 2018, I only saw one wave of Hancitor malspam that occurred on Wednesday 2018-01-10.

But on Tuesday 2018-01-23, we saw a new wave of Hancitor malspam.  This time, links in the emails returned an RTF file that exploits CVE-2017-11882.

As usual, these waves of malspam are most often caught by spam filters, so few people will actually see the messages.  And best security practices can easily prevent these infections from happening.

But we continue to see this malspam, so today's diary examines the infection traffic in my lab environment.
