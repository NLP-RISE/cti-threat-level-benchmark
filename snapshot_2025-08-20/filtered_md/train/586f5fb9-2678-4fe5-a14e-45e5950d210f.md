* comment: Disable AV, Reload Without Resistance

We also noticed that the malware using this driver causes the system to reboot after installing the driver. This causes the targeted AV software not to be loaded after the system restores, enabling the malware to execute without disturbance.

The driver performs this action because the user-mode code canâ€™t overwrite AV registry data; it employs self-protections to prevent exactly that. However, when executed by a driver, which can carry out more actions on a deeper privilege level, it is much harder to prevent such actions.
