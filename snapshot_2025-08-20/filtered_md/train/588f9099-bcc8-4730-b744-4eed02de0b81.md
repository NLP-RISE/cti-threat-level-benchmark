### External analysis
* text: On Jan 20, 2017, we came across a malware that appeared to be a new Ransomware family called Sage 2.0. Within a couple of days we were able to collect more than 200 malware binaries across our sensors associated with this new Ransomware. Last week, Brad Duncan also wrote a SANS InfoSec Diary entry on Sage 2.0, noticing some strange UDP packets sent to over 7'000 different IPs:
