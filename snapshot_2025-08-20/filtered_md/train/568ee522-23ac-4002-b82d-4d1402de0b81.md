* comment: Weâ€™ve spotted an advertising campaign that tricks users into clicking on what looks like a notification alert that actually hides a legitimate advert, therefore abusing both the advertiser and the ad network hosting the ad (Google Ads Services).

The rogue actors behind this fraudulent activity are cleverly leveraging a European law on the use of cookies to seemingly prompt visitors to answer a question.
