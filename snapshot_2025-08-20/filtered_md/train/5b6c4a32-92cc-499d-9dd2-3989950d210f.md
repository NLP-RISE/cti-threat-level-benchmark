* text: The SamSam ransomware has earned its creator(s) more than $5.9 million in ransom payments since late 2015, according to the most comprehensive report ever published on SamSam's activity, containing information since the ransomware's launch in late 2015 and up to attacks that have happened earlier this month.

Compiled by UK cyber-security firm Sophos, the 47-page report is a result of researchers collecting data from past attacks, talking to victims, and data-mining public and private sources for SamSam samples that might have slipped through the cracks.

In addition, Sophos researchers also partnered with blockchain & cryptocurrency monitoring firm Neutrino to track down transfers and relations between the different Bitcoin addresses the SamSam crew has used until now.
