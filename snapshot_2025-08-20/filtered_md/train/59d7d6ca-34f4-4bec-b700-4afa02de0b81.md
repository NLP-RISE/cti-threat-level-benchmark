* text: We observed several high-volume FormBook malware distribution campaigns primarily taking aim at Aerospace, Defense Contractor, and Manufacturing sectors within the U.S. and South Korea during the past few months. The attackers involved in these email campaigns leveraged a variety of distribution mechanisms to deliver the information stealing FormBook malware, including:

    PDFs with download links
    DOC and XLS files with malicious macros
    Archive files (ZIP, RAR, ACE, and ISOs) containing EXE payloads

The PDF and DOC/XLS campaigns primarily impacted the United States and the Archive campaigns largely impacted the Unites States and South Korea.
