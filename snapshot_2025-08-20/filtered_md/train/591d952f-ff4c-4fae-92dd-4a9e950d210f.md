* comment: A littler over a week ago, a member posted a topic in our forums looking for help regarding a new ransomware that they were infected with. For this particular victim, the ransomware was appending the _2883765424.UIWIX extension to their files and was creating ransom notes named _DECODE_FILES.txt. Over the next few days, a few more victims posted in the thread and we saw an increasing amount of encrypted files submitted to our malware submission system and ID-Ransomware.
