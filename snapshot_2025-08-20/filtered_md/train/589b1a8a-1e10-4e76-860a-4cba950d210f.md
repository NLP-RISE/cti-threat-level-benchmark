### External analysis

* comment: A sample of a potentially new ransomware called Erebus has been discovered by MalwareHunterTeam on VirusTotal. I say that this is a potentially new ransomware because TrendMicro had reported another ransomware using the same name was previously released back in September 2016. Though I do not have a sample of the original Erebus, from its outward characteristics, the one discovered today looks like either a complete rewrite or a new ransomware using the same name..
