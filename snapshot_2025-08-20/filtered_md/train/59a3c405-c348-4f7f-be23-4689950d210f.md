* comment: Over the weekend, Emsisoft security researcher xXToffeeXx discovered a new ransomware called Reyptson that is targeting Spanish victims. Since then, we have seen increased activity in the ransomware's developmen. Today security researcher MalwareHunterTeam took a deeper look and noticed that Reyptson conducts its own spam distribution campaign directly from a victim's configured Thunderbird email account.
