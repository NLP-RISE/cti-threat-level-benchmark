## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
### External analysis
* text: Snake, also known as Turla, Uroburos and Agent.BTZ, is a relatively complex malware framework used for targeted attacks1.

Over the past year Fox-IT has been involved in multiple incident response cases where the Snake framework was used to steal sensitive information. Targets include government institutions, military and large corporates.

Researchers who have previously analyzed compromises where Snake was used have attributed the attacks to Russia2. Compared to other prolific attackers with alleged ties to Russia, such as APT28 (Fancy Bear) and APT29 (Cozy Bear), Snakeâ€™s code is significantly more sophisticated, itâ€™s infrastructure more complex and targets more carefully selected.

The framework has traditionally focused on the Windows operating system, but in 2014 the first Linux variant was observed3.

Now, Fox-IT has identified a version of Snake targeting Mac OS X.
As this version contains debug functionalities and was signed on February 21st, 2017 it is likely that the OS X version of Snake is not yet operational.
Fox-IT expects that the attackers using Snake will soon use the Mac OS X variant on targets.
