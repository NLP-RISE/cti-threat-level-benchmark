## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
### External analysis
* text: Forcepoint Security Labsâ„¢ came across a malicious reconnaissance campaign that targets websites. It is unknown what is the intent behind the campaign as of this writing, however, the profile of the targets resembles those that are common targets of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors. As the attack is currently active, it effectively turns compromised sites into attack surfaces against their visitors.

Furthermore, the injections resemble those used by the Turla group, such as those previously documented by Swiss GovCERT last year. In this post, we will share our findings on this campaign's targets and injected code as well as provide insights to its timeline.
