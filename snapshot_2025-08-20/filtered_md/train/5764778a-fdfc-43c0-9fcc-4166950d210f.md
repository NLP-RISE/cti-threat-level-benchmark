* comment: Much attention has been focused recently on ransomware and other threats that go after consumers and businesses directly for monetary payouts. Still, point-of-sale (POS) malware continues to be an important source of stolen credit card data and associated revenue for cyber criminals.

The ongoing rollout of chip-and-pin credit cards and tighter standards following the retail megabreaches of 2014 have put further pressure on the POS malware black market. But as we have seen with the AbaddonPOS malware described here, POS malware is not just alive and wellâ€”itâ€™s being actively developed.

On May 5, a financially motivated actor whom Proofpoint has been tracking as TA530 (also featured in our previous blog post "Phish Scales" [1]) sent out a highly-personalized email campaign targeting primarily retail companies and attempting to install TinyLoader and AbaddonPOS point-of-sale malware. The retail vertical was likely chosen due to the higher likelihood of infecting a POS system. We first observed AbaddonPOS when it was delivered by Vawtrak [2] in October of 2015. We have also found that TinyLoader and AbaddonPOS have since been updated in several ways.
