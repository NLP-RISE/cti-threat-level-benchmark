* comment: Proofpoint researchers discovered a never-before-documented malware strain on February 15. Dropped by the Nuclear exploit kit, further investigation showed that the malware was a new Trojan called Thanatos by its developers and that we refer to internally as "Alphabot".

Thanatos is being marketed as a service with both short and long-term subscriptions and support and the authors claim it is under ongoing development with new plugins and functionality being actively added.
