### External analysis
* comment: Today, MalwareHunterTeam discovered a new variant of the CryptoMix ransomware that appends the .TEST extension to encrypted files and changes the contact emails used by the ransomware.

As we are always looking for weaknesses, if you are a victim of this variant and decide to pay the ransom, please send us the decryptor so we can take a look at it.
