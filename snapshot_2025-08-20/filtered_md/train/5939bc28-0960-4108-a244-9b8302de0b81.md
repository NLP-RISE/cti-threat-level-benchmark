## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
### External analysis
* text: The recent White House leaks allegedly began shortly after President Trumpâ€™s inauguration. According to Wired, â€œâ€¦ multiple reports indicate that Republican operatives and White House staffers are using end-to-end encrypted messaging app Confide [sic].â€ Confideâ€™s website touts the product as â€œYour Confidential Messenger. With encrypted messages that self-destruct, Confide gives you the comfort of knowing that your private messages will now truly stay that way.â€

IOActive researchers subsequently pointed out vulnerabilities in the Confide app on Windows, macOS, and Android. Given the increasing popularity of encrypted messaging apps, Insikt Group was curious about other encrypted messaging apps that might be vulnerable to attack.

The curiosity led to exploration in ReversingLabâ€™s (Recorded Futureâ€™s research partner) malicious file data, specifically Android files. An Android Spyware file surfaced in late 2016, labeled by ESET as Android/Spy.Kasandra.A trojan (variant), and G Data labeled it Android.Trojan-Spy.SandroRAT.A, more commonly known as DroidJack.
