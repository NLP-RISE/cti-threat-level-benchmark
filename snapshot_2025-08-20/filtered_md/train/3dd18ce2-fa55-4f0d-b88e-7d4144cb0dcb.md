* [Other] text: Egregor is considered to be one of the most prolific ransomware threat groups. Yet it gained this reputation in a very short time due to its uncompromising double extortion methodology.In this report, we will provide a detailed and anonymized coverage of Egregor’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) following an incident response activity that was conducted at the end of November 2020.  The goal of this report is to shed light on some very different techniques for initial access, persistence, and exfiltration than what is typically reported on with respect to the Egregor group. In this report, you will not find any indication of Qbot or Cobalt Strike beacons.Though we are not going to provide an exact attribution, you will find evidence in the report that may indicate a connection to the Revil group. We will provide evidence such as upload accounts, download links, and services that can result in additional community wide research which hopefully can lead to further conclusions.We invite the research community to share additional insights that may correlate with the published IOCs.
