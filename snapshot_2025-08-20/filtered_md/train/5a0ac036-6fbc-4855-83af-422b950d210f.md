* comment: The threat to information is greater than ever, with data breaches, phishing attacks, and other forms of information theft like point-of-sale malware and ATM hacks becoming all too common in today's threat landscape. Information-stealing trojans are in the same category of threats that deliver a steady stream of risk to data and can lead to significant financial loss.

Qakbot and Emotet are information stealers that have been showing renewed activity in recent months. These malware families are technically different, but they share many similarities in behavior. They both have the ultimate goal of stealing online banking credentials that malware operators can then use to steal money from online banking accounts. They can also steal other sensitive information using techniques like keylogging.
