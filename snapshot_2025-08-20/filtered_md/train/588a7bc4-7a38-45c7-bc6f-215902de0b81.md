* text: â€¢ First observed in July 2014, â€œDridex,â€ a financial banking Trojan, is considered the successor to the â€œGameOver ZeuSâ€ (GoZ) malware.

â€¢ Dridex was most active between 2014 and 2015, and smaller campaigns were observed throughout 2016 with its peak activity in May 2016.

â€¢ On January 25, 2017, the criminal syndicate behind Dridex launched another small campaign targeting UK financial institutions.

â€¢ Flashpoint identified a previously-unobserved Dridex User Account Control (UAC) bypass method characterized by its use of recdisc[.]exe, a Windows default recovery disc executable, and its loading of malicious code via impersonated SPP[.]dll.

â€¢ The new Dridex infection uses svchost and spoolsrv to communicate to peers and first-layer command-and-control (C2) servers.
