### External analysis
* comment: On April 25, 2016, Blue Coat published an article on a new Android Ransomware, called "Dogspectus.â€ On May 12, 2016, Dell SonicWALL published a separate report on the Android Lockscreen malware campaign with similar characteristics to Dogspectus. These similarities are not a coincidence. We began our own extensive investigation into this ransomware some time ago, and will share additional technical details of this malware here that have not been previously discussed.
