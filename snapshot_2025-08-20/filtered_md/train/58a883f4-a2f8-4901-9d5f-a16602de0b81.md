* text: Hot news about successful attacks on Polish banks appeared recently on the Polish security portal ZaufanaTrzeciaStrona.pl (translated in English here). The impact of the attacks was described dramatically with adjectives like â€œthe most seriousâ€. The initial reports were very recently supported by two blogposts by Symantec and BAE Systems. The nationalities of affected institutions were extended also to Mexico and Uruguay, with even more high-profile targets in the attackersâ€™ viewfinder that are located worldwide. There are many interesting aspects to these attacks starting from the targets, moving on to the vector of compromise, right up to the specific features of the malicious executables used. While the first two aspects have been quite thoroughly examined so far, the malicious binaries involved havenâ€™t received much attention so far. The purpose of this blog post is to deliver technical details of this as-yet minimally documented malware.
