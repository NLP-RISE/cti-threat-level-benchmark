* comment: When we saw the Kelihos botnet delivering ransomware last month on July 8th, we sat up and took notice.  The Kelihos botnet has a long history of delivering pharma spam and stock market manipulation spam (pump-n-dump), but now it was spamming the WildFire ransomware. ( See: http://garwarner.blogspot.com/2016/07/kelihos-botnet-delivering-dutch.html )  I was under the impression that it was one of the occasional gimmicks observed with Kelihos where they try something a single time and then move on.  I assumed that some script kiddies were testing new ransomware techniques. Unfortunately, I was wrong and Kelihos hit back with CryptFIle2 encryption ransomware.
