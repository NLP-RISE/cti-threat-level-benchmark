* [Other] text: In December, we published a summary of BatLoader activity whereby Google Search Ads were used to impersonate software such as WinRAR to deliver malicious Windows Installer files. The installer files contained custom action commands which used PowerShell to download and execute payloads (Redline Stealer, Ursnif, etc.) hosted on legitimate websites.

Throughout February 2023, TRU has observed a series of newly registered websites impersonating various applications and brands. Included among these are:

ChatGPT (chatgpt-t[.]com)
Zoom (zoomvideor[.]com)
Spotify (spotify-uss[.]com)
Tableau (tableau-r[.]com)
Adobe (adobe-l[.]com)
In addition to comparable domain registration attributes, these websites tend to follow a similar naming convention where one or more characters are appended to the impersonated brand name (e.g., adobe-l[.]com vs adobe.com). These sites were used to host imposter download pages and all likely stem from malicious advertisements on Google Search Ads. A more complete list can be found at the end of this post.

BatLoader continues to see changes and improvement since it first emerged in 2022. Recent samples analyzed by TRU utilize Windows Installer files masquerading as the above applications to launch embedded Python scripts.
