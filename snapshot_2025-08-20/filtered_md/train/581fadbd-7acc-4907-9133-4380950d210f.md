* comment: Proofpoint researchers recently observed a novel targeted phishing attack that combined Outlook Web Access (OWA) credential phishing with a malicious document download.  In May we also observed an Office 365 credential phishing attack leading to iSpy Keylogger [1], but the combination of OWA with this infection chain takes a different approach. While it is not clear whether the primary goal of the attack was delivering the malicious payload or capturing the targets' OWA credentials, this attack uses an OWA phish to additionally pushes a malicious document with a Veil-Framework payload capable of downloading further malware.
